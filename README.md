# Infrastrucutre as a Code (IaC)
IaC basically means when a devops engineer wants to automate the process of initializing/killing any cloud services this engineer needs to write code using either AWS CLI/SDK/API Calling. For this the devops engineers need so much of coding knowledge. So IaC came into picture where it uses templates for writing these codes when you send instructions for this using yml/json format files. This is basically called IaC.
There are various IaC tools for various cloud providers like AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), etc. But when you are migrating from one cloud provider to another you need to learn the IaC tool of that provider again. So instead of this we can use Terraform. Terraform uses API to talk with other cloud providers, user should just mention which provider to talk with and what to do in the .tf files. 
Before the advent of IaC, infrastructure management was typically a manual and time-consuming process. System administrators and operations teams had to:

Manually Configure Servers: Servers and other infrastructure components were often set up and configured manually, which could lead to inconsistencies and errors.

Lack of Version Control: Infrastructure configurations were not typically version-controlled, making it difficult to track changes or revert to previous states.

Documentation Heavy: Organizations relied heavily on documentation to record the steps and configurations required for different infrastructure setups. This documentation could become outdated quickly.

Limited Automation: Automation was limited to basic scripting, often lacking the robustness and flexibility offered by modern IaC tools.

Slow Provisioning: Provisioning new resources or environments was a time-consuming process that involved multiple manual steps, leading to delays in project delivery.

IaC addresses these challenges by providing a systematic, automated, and code-driven approach to infrastructure management. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager templates others.

These tools enable organizations to define, deploy, and manage their infrastructure efficiently and consistently, making it easier to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern applications and services.
# Getting started with Terraform 
Terraform is cloud-agnostic and supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and others. This allows users to manage resources across different cloud environments using a single set of configuration files.
Terraform uses API as code
 A provider is a plugin for Terraform that defines and manages resources for a specific cloud or infrastructure platform. Examples of providers include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others.
A resource is a specific infrastructure component that you want to create and manage using Terraform. Resources can include virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, network components, and more.
A module is a reusable and encapsulated unit of Terraform code. Modules allow you to package infrastructure configurations, making it easier to maintain, share, and reuse them across different parts of your infrastructure
Terraform uses configuration files (often with a .tf extension) to define the desired infrastructure state.
Terraform maintains a state file (often named terraform.tfstate) that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure.

# AWS CLI 

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for managing your AWS services from the command line. It allows you to interact with AWS services directly through commands rather than using the AWS Management Console. Here's a basic overview of how to install and use the AWS CLI

The AWS CLI is built on top of Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.

If you have python installed
Steps to install  AWS CLI using Python 
Once Python is installed, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install the AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager)
"pip install awscli"

 Verify the installation:
 "aws --version"
 Configure AWS credentials:

Before using the AWS CLI, you need to configure your AWS credentials. Run the following command and follow the prompts:
"aws configure"

 Also you can refer this documents "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/"

# Deep dive into different aspects in the project 
We tried to use different concepts related to AWS and terraform and tried to automate as much as possible 

# Overview 
This project implements a serverless chatbot on AWS Lambda using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC). The goal is to showcase best practices for serverless architecture, code reuse through Terraform modules, and utilize AWS services such as S3 for remote backend and DynamoDB for locking.

# Introduction 
Welcome to the "Serverless Chatbot using AWS Lambda/Terraform" project! This initiative is designed to showcase the seamless integration of AWS services and Terraform for building a robust and scalable serverless chatbot. By leveraging the power of AWS Lambda, Terraform's infrastructure as code (IaC) capabilities, and best practices in DevOps, this project serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to delve into serverless architectures and cloud-based chatbot solutions.

# Prerequisites
AWS knowledge
Terraform applications 
How to use AWS CLI 

# Application 
Imagine you work for an IT department in a large organization, and you want to enhance user support and streamline issue resolution. In this scenario, the serverless chatbot serves as an intelligent IT support assistant, leveraging AWS Lambda for serverless execution and Terraform for infrastructure management.

# Example installation commands
terraform init (Initializes your terraform state, lock files)
terraform plan (Gives you a plan of what terraform is gonna do )
terraform apply (This command is used to apply the infrastructure )
terraform destroy (This command is used to destroy the infrastucture)

# Configuration
Access the AWS role and get the access key and secret key 
Also configuring a webex bot using its access token 

# Terraform Modules
Terraform modules are reusable, self-contained units of Terraform configuration that encapsulate specific pieces of infrastructure or functionality. They allow you to organize and structure your Terraform code in a modular and maintainable way. Modules are defined using the Terraform configuration language (HCL) and can be used to create resources, define configurations, or encapsulate logic.

# Remote Backend

Remote backend stores the Terraform state file outside of your local file system and version control. Using S3 as a remote backend is a popular choice due to its reliability and scalability.Terraform Remote Backend is a crucial component that allows Terraform to store and retrieve its state files remotely. The state file in Terraform is a JSON representation of the infrastructure that Terraform manages. Remote backends can vary depending on the cloud provider or service you choose. Common options include S3 for AWS, Azure Storage for Azure, and Google Cloud Storage for Google Cloud Platform. Additionally, Terraform supports backends like HTTP, Consul, and more. Choose the backend that best fits your infrastructure and collaboration requirements.

# Locking Mechanism

In Terraform, a locking mechanism is used to prevent multiple users or processes from concurrently modifying the same Terraform state file. When multiple people or systems are working with Terraform simultaneously, the locking mechanism ensures that only one operation can modify the state file at a time, preventing conflicts and data corruption. Terraform uses a distributed locking mechanism, typically implemented using a backend system, to coordinate access to the state file. The two common components involved in the locking mechanism are the backend (where the state is stored remotely) and a locking table (often implemented using a distributed key-value store like DynamoDB in AWS). The locking mechanism in Terraform helps maintain the integrity of the state file in collaborative and concurrent deployment scenarios, preventing conflicts and ensuring a consistent and reliable infrastructure provisioning process.
# Usage
 Clone this using Git clone and try intializing the terraform using "terraform init" 
After cloning the repo don't forget to change the variables for the AWS configuration 
Then run "terraform plan" to check what all infra is getting executed. 
Now use "terraform apply" and see the magic
